### Problem: Union of Two Arrays
### Language: Python
### Date: 27 May 2025

## ✅ Problem Statement:
Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively, find the count of distinct elements present in the union of both arrays.

## 💡 Approach:
- Combine both arrays using a + b

- Convert the combined array to a set to eliminate duplicates

- Return the length of the set as the count of unique elements

- A one-liner solution using Python’s set feature.

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n + m) — due to concatenation and set conversion

- Space Complexity: O(n + m) — storing elements in a set
